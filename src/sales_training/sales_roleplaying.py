        Overall Evaluation: 3

        The sales representative did a good job in building rapport with the customer and understanding their needs. 
        However, there was room for improvement in the use of sales tools and the demonstration and closing of the product. 
        The representative successfully summarized the customer's needs and secured their agreement, but could have been more persuasive in the closing. 
        The appreciation and feedback stage was also lacking, with only a modest thanks and feedback request.
        Overall, the sales representative successfully reinforced the customer promise, but there is room for improvement in certain areas to enhance the overall sales experience.
